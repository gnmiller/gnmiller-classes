PROGRAM 3 README

QUESTION 1:
	The number of comparisons is n(n-1)/2 and not n^2 because if we were to do 
n^2 comparisons we would be comparing several values multiple times 
(redundant).

QUESTION 2:
	It is entirely possible that several threads will write into the same index
simultaneously. However, this does not cause a race condition (or other issues).
This is because all threads are writing the same value (0) into any slot in the
array. Regardless of it is a 1 or 0 when the value is altered it will become 0
after the instruction completes. The values are never read, and no process
relies on their value until after all threads writing into w[] have completed.

QUESTION 3:
	In general the algorithm holds true when nondistinct integers are presented.
When presented with nondistinct integers that are not the greatest the algorithm
detects this appropriately and marks them (as they are less than w[]'s max). When
the nondistinct values are the largest the algorithm, in this implementation, 
always selects the second presented value and the first instance will be marked 
as the largest, when compared to the lesser values the are processed as normal.
