Trace complete.

D)
	The largest delay was introduced during the hop from Chicago to New York. I would have guessed it would occur hopping from the US (likely in NY) going out
to the UK as that would certainly be the longest by distance (~4x larger distance).

E)
	tracert continues to send data when a router doesn't respond because that node is usually still traversed by the packet. The node in question
may have ping response disabled, or not responded for some other reason but still received, and transmitted the data.
