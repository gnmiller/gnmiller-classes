prog1: Check the endian-ness of a system and report it. Then reverse DNS lookup the address specified on STDIN.
prog2: Make a static HTTP request to a server for the address <server address>/ (eg index.html in most cases)
prog3: A simple HTTP server that automatically responds to any request with the index.html file in the same directory. 
    Was initially specified to only require 1 connection but was later modified to include pthreads to allow (theoretically) infinite concurrent connections
prog4: An implementation of a connection based protocol (like TCP) implemented using UDP packets. Does not work in all cases on all systems.
prog5: Similar to prog1 but instead of recursively querying DNS servers the application starts at the root node and queries from those responses.
    Only partially works. The recursive query portion is unworking, the application currently retrieves the response from the normal DNS, parses the packet and outputs
    the results to STDOUT.
